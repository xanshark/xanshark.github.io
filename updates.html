        <h6>07/31/2025</h6>
        <h6>Aside from registering for all of the</h6>
        <h6>fanlistings, I've also added a chat</h6>
        <h6>box and fixed some issues with the</h6>
        <h6>code for centering the website.</h6>
        <h6>Now everything's properly centered</h6>
        <h6>and the site is now viewable in 4:3!</h6>
        <h6>Unless the chat box doesn't work</h6>
        <h6>(it won't load with the VSCodium</h6>
        <h6>preview), I'll be taking a break from</h6>
        <h6>working on this site for now.</h6>

        <h6>The redesign is live! It's really great</h6>
        <h6>to finally have a nice looking site.</h6>
        <h6>All that's left to do now is I need to</h6>
        <h6>register for all of those fanlistings.</h6>
        <h6>Once I'm done with that, though, I</h6>
        <h6>doubt I'll do anything to this site</h6>
        <h6>for a while. I want to take a break</h6>
        <h6>from it for a bit.</h6>
